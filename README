

Configurations:
---------------
A json file with running configurations must exist next to the script or executable.
Such configuration file must be named: "configs.json"
The configurations are:
- hostname: the hostname where the SAST manager being instrumented is running
            must be a server responding to REST calls
            can be http or https formated (self signed certificates are accepted)
            a port, if other than standard, can be include.
            examples: localhost  http://localhost  https://localhost  http://localhost:80  https://localhost:443
- username: the user used to connect to the SAST with proper authorizations
            usually a service user
- password: the password for the user above
- promport: the port the service exposes to prometheus
            do not forget your firewalls
- loglevel: the level of information written to the logfile			
            options are:
               50 = CRITICAL/FATAL
               40 = ERROR
               30 = WARNING
               20 = INFO
               10 = DEBUG
                0 = NOTSET (logs nothing)			
            default is 20 (INFO)
             
Example of a configurations file:
{	
    "hostname": "https://localhost:443",
    "username": "myservice",
    "password": "mypassword",
    "promport": 9700,
    "loglevel": 40
}


Location of logfile:
-------------------
Log file is located at the folder "logs" relative to the running path.
The logfile name is "cxprometheus.log"


Creating an executable file from the python script:
---------------------------------------------------
1. Install the tool "pyinstaller" using "pip install pyinstaller"
2. Execute the command "pyinstaller --onefile cxprometheus.py"
The executable will be placed on ./dist folder
This is valuable for Windows and for Linux
